Learning XOR Function with 2-layer Neural Network
==================================================

A bare bones implementation of neural network with back-prop for evaluation of gradient. 
Minimization performed with a gradient descent. 

## Training Data with label ##
 (0,0) --> 0

 (0,1) --> 1 

 (1,0) --> 1 

 (1,1) --> 0 
 
##  Details  ## 
 
##  Files  ##
learn_xor_hidden_bprp.m - Main Script. **Run this file

forward_pass.m - Function to evaluate the forward pass 

forward_pass_predict.m - Function to just make prediction with forward pass

backward_pass.m - Evaluation of gradient with back propagation 

eval_performance.m - evaluation of the performance of the trained network <br/>
