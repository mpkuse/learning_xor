Learning XOR Function with 2-layer Neural Network
==================================================

A bare bones implementation of neural network with back-prop for evaluation of gradient. 
Minimization performed with a gradient descent. 

Training Data with label
-------------------------
 (0,0) --> 0 <br/>
 (0,1) --> 1 <br/>
 (1,0) --> 1 <br/>
 (1,1) --> 0 <br/>
